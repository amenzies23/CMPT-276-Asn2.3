# CMPT276-Asn2.3
This webpage will allow the functionality to add, modify, and delete students from the database. In the initial page it will dipslay all the students showing features about the students. The border color is their hair color. The text color is according to their GPA (0-1 is red, 1-3 is yellow, 3-4 is green) Their height is multiplied by a big factor to show it proportionally to their weight, so when somebody is taller it is visible from the front page.\
I wanted to have the students display in lines horizontally but I couldn't get that working right in the timeframe for the assignment.\
My repository init commit is the entire program because on my past repositories I had problems deploying to render.com since I didn't have my init commit in the root of the program.
